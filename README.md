## Introduction

we present MoMA: an open-vocabulary, training-free personalized image model that boasts flexible zero-shot capabilities. As foundational text-to-image models rapidly evolve, the demand for robust image-to-image translation grows. Addressing this need, MoMA specializes in subject-driven personalized image generation. Utilizing an open-source, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), we train MoMA to serve a dual role as both a feature extractor and a generator. This approach effectively synergizes reference image and text prompt information to produce valuable image features, facilitating an image diffusion model. To better leverage the generated features, we further introduce a novel self-attention shortcut method that efficiently transfers image features to an image diffusion model, improving the resemblance of the target object in generated images. Remarkably, as a tuning-free plug-and-play module, our model requires only a single reference image and outperforms existing methods in generating images with high detail fidelity, enhanced identity-preservation and prompt faithfulness. We commit to making our work open-source, thereby providing universal access to these advancements.

## Release
- [2024/04/20] ðŸ”¥ We release the model code on Github.
- [2024/04/22] ðŸ”¥ We add HuggingFace reposity and release the checkpoints.


## Installation
1. Install latest diffusers
```
pip install diffusers
```
2. Install LlaVA: 
Please install from its [official repository](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#install)

3. Download our MoMA repository
```
git clone https://github.com/KunpengSong/MoMA.git
cd MoMA
```

## Memory Requirements
We support 8 bit and 4 bit inferences which reduce the memory consumptions: 
+ if you have 22 Gb or more GPU memory:
```args.load_8bit, args.load_4bit = False, False```

+ if you have 18 Gb or more GPU memory:
```args.load_8bit, args.load_4bit = True, False```

+ if you have 14 Gb or more GPU memory:
```args.load_8bit, args.load_4bit = False, True```



## Download Models

**You don't have to download any checkpoints**, our code will automatically download them from [HuggingFace repositories](https://huggingface.co/KunpengSong/MoMA_llava_7b/tree/main), which includes:
```
VAE: stabilityai--sd-vae-ft-mse
StableDiffusion: Realistic_Vision_V4.0_noVAE
MoMA: 
    Multi-modal LLM: MoMA_llava_7b (13 GB)
    Attentions and mappings: attn_adapters_projectors.th (151 Mb)
```

## How to Use

### SD_1.5 (Realistic_Vision_V4.0)

- If you prefer Jupyter-notebook: [**run_MoMA_notebook.ipynb**](run_MoMA_notebook.ipynb)
- If you prefer Python code: [**run_evaluate_MoMA.py**](run_evaluate_MoMA.py)

New context:

New texture:
![change texture](assets/texture.png)


**Hyper parameter:**
- In "changing context", you can increase the `strength` to get more accurate details. Mostly,`strength=1.0` is the best. It's recommended that `strength` is no greater than `1.2`.
- In "changing texture", you can decrease the `strength` to balance between detail accuracy and prompt fidelity. To get better prompt fidelity, you can decrease `strength`. Mostly,`strength=0.4` is the best. It's recommended that `strength` is no grater than `0.6`.
